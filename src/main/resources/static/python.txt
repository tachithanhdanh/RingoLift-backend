Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and released in 1991. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
Python's syntax allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. Its extensive standard library and active community make it a powerful language for a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.
