In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. Behind this door lay a tube-shaped hall, a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, lined with warm wood paneling and filled with polished hooks for hats and coats. The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill - The Hill, as all the people for many miles around called it - and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another.

The best rooms were all on the left-hand side (going in), for these were the only ones to have windows, deep-set round windows looking over his garden and meadows beyond, sloping down to the river. This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the neighborhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.

Bilbo Baggins' home, Bag End, was considered one of the finest hobbit-holes in all of Hobbiton. The main entrance hall gleamed with well-polished wooden floors, adorned with intricately woven rugs from the markets of Bree. Maps of the Shire hung in ornate frames, alongside portraits of various Baggins ancestors, their round faces bearing the same comfortable, well-fed look that characterized most hobbits.

The pantry was a marvel to behold, with row upon row of shelves stocked with preserves, jams, and honey. Wheels of cheese aged on cedar boards, while hams and sausages hung from the rafters. Barrels of ale from the Green Dragon Inn sat alongside bottles of Old Winyards, a wine that had been laid down by Bilbo's father, Bungo. The kitchen, heart of any proper hobbit-hole, boasted copper pots and pans that shone like mirrors, a massive hearth for cooking, and a breakfast nook that caught the morning sun.

The study was Bilbo's particular pride, lined with books both common and rare. Some told tales of distant lands and ancient battles, others contained elvish poetry and songs, while still more held the extensive Baggins family history. A large desk of dark wood sat before the window, where Bilbo often wrote in his journal or worked on translations of elvish texts.

The parlor was furnished for comfort, with overstuffed chairs and sofas, each with its own carefully crocheted antimacassar. A magnificent fireplace dominated one wall, its mantelpiece carved with scenes of trees and flowers. Above it hung the family sword, unused for generations but kept polished out of tradition. The room was perfect for afternoon tea, which Bilbo took promptly at four o'clock each day, featuring his mother's best china and silver spoons that had been in the family for generations.

The bedrooms were cozy havens, with feather beds and quilts stitched by various aunts and cousins. Each room had its own brass bedwarmer, though they were rarely needed as the hobbit-hole maintained a pleasant temperature year-round. Circular windows provided views of the garden, where roses climbed trellises and butterflies danced among the hollyhocks.

The garden itself was Bilbo's other great joy, tended with the help of young Hamfast Gamgee. There were flower beds bursting with colors: snapdragons, daisies, and sunflowers in summer; chrysanthemums and asters in autumn. The vegetable garden produced prize-winning pumpkins, tomatoes sweeter than honey, and peas that were the envy of Hobbiton. A gnarled apple tree, planted by Bungo Baggins himself, provided shade for afternoon reading and fruit for autumn pies.

Storage rooms tunneled deeper into the hill, each with its specific purpose. One held wines and spirits, another preserved foods for winter, while a third contained holiday decorations and family heirlooms. The walls were lined with shelves and cupboards, all meticulously organized and labeled in Bilbo's precise handwriting.

The smoking room was a smaller chamber but no less comfortable, with a rack of pipes, including his father's long-stemmed pipe with its silver band. Jars of Old Toby and Longbottom Leaf, the finest pipe-weed in the Southfarthing, sat within easy reach of the cushioned window seat. Here, Bilbo would often sit in the evenings, blowing smoke rings and watching them drift out the window into the gathering dusk.

Every room had its own character, yet all shared that indefinable quality that made a hobbit-hole a home. The corners were rounded, the ceilings followed gentle curves, and everywhere there were little nooks and crannies perfect for storing the odds and ends that hobbits loved to collect. The air was always fresh, carrying the scent of flowers from the garden or bread baking in the kitchen.

But perhaps most remarkable was how the entire hole felt of permanence and peace. Generations of Bagginses had lived here, each adding their own touches while respecting what had come before. It was a place where time moved slowly and contentedly, where the greatest adventures were found in books, and where comfort was not just a feature but a way of life.

Little did Bilbo know that this comfortable existence was about to be disrupted by an unexpected visitor, one who would set in motion adventures far beyond anything a respectable Baggins should encounter. But for now, he sat in his garden, pipe in hand, watching the morning smoke rings rise into the perfectly blue sky above The Hill.
