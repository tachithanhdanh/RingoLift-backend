The hallway smelled of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of the hallway, a colored poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a meter wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black mustache and ruggedly handsome features. Big Brother is Watching You, the caption beneath it ran.

Inside his flat, Winston moved toward the window, his squat, frail figure made more grotesque by the blue overalls that were the uniform of the Party. He was thirty-nine, had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, and moved with a perpetual stoop. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was not supposed to use the lift because of the current electricity savings, moved slowly, stopping several times to rest.

On each landing, opposite the lift shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. The dark eyes followed Winston as he turned toward the staircase. Inside the flat, a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely.

Winston moved to his small kitchen area, where the bitter smell of synthetic gin still lingered from the previous night. He had consumed the entire bottle, yet his hands still trembled as he reached for the coffee substitute rationed by the Ministry of Plenty. The granules were coarse and bitter, nothing like real coffee, which he could barely remember from his childhood.

Through the window, he could see the Ministry of Truth rising vast and white above the grimy landscape. Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia. Or was it Eurasia? Winston's mind wandered dangerously as he tried to remember, but the harder he focused, the more the memories slipped away like water through his fingers.

The telescreen suddenly blared to life with increased volume, making Winston jump. "Attention, comrades! Attention! We have glorious news from the chocolate ration front! The Ministry of Plenty has succeeded in raising the chocolate ration to twenty grams per week!" Winston's stomach turned. Hadn't it been thirty grams last week? He pushed the thought away quickly, practicing doublethink as he had been trained.

He sat down at the small desk in the alcove, careful to keep his back to the telescreen. From his coat pocket he took out a small diary he had purchased illicitly at a prole shop. The cream-colored pages were slightly yellowed, of a kind no longer manufactured. The mere possession of this diary was not illegal—nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws—but if detected, it would be reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forced-labor camp.

Winston dipped his pen in ink. The telescreen was bellowing martial music. He tried to squeeze out some memory, some childhood recollection that might serve as a starting point, but it was no use. The telescreen began another announcement about increased production in the textile sector. Winston stared at the blank page. A sense of complete helplessness descended upon him.

For whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary? For the future, for the unborn? His mind hovered for a moment around the doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeak word DOUBLETHINK. How could one communicate with the future? It was impossible by its very nature. Either the future would resemble the present, in which case it would not listen to him, or it would be different from it, and his predicament would be meaningless.

A sharp pain shot through his bowels. He had been neglecting his exercises. The Physical Jerks would begin in three minutes. Winston forced himself to stand, his muscles protesting. Through the window, he could see rows of other apartments, their occupants likely preparing for the same morning ritual. In the distance, a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the Police Patrol, snooping into people's windows.

The telescreen issued a piercing whistle. "Thirty seconds to Physical Jerks!" announced an enthusiastic female voice. "Take your places, please! Comrades in apartments six-zero-one to six-twenty-five, attention!"

Winston positioned himself in front of the telescreen, where the instructress, a tight-bodied young woman in a smart athletic tunic, was already demonstrating the first exercise. "Arms bending and stretching!" she shouted. "Take your time by me. One, two, three, four!"

The pain of the movement was almost immediately forgotten in the wave of horror that swept through Winston as he caught sight of himself in the reflection of a small wall mirror. What he saw was more alarming than usual: a lined, aging face, gray skin, dark bags under the eyes. Had he always looked so old? Had the Party aged him prematurely, or was this simply what forty looked like? He couldn't remember.

The instructress's voice pierced through his thoughts. "Comrade Six-Zero-Nine, you're not trying! Lower, please! Watch me again." Winston dropped lower into the exercise, sweat beginning to form on his forehead. The morning sun, weak and cold through the window, cast long shadows across the room. Somewhere, far away, a rocket bomb exploded with a dull reverberation that made the building tremble.

He wondered, not for the first time, if he was alone in harboring thoughts of rebellion against the Party. Surely there must be others who remembered a different world, who saw through the endless propaganda and surveillance. But if they existed, how would he ever find them? How could anyone maintain a rebellion in a world where every sound was overheard, every movement scrutinized?

The exercise session continued relentlessly, each movement a small torture, each breath a reminder of his own mortality. And all the while, the poster of Big Brother watched, those dark eyes following every movement, seeing every doubt, reading every treasonous thought that might flicker through Winston's mind.
