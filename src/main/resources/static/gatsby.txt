In my younger and more vulnerable years, my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. His words, though simple, were laden with wisdom that I would not fully comprehend until years later. "Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."

He didn't elaborate much, yet the weight of his statement stayed with me. My father was never one for long-winded speeches or excessive explanations; instead, his guidance often came in the form of concise, thought-provoking sentences. In this case, he had opened my eyes to the reality of privilege and the biases that I, even at that young age, might not have recognized. He was urging me to consider the bigger picture and to be mindful of the circumstances that shaped others, even when they appeared to be flawed or different from myself.

We’ve always been unusually communicative in a reserved way. My family didn’t indulge in casual conversation often, but when we did speak, it was meaningful. Our dialogues were always rooted in respect and introspection, with my father often providing me with the insights that, at the time, I couldn’t fully grasp. Yet, as I grew older, I realized that his words had greater depth than I could have understood as a child. He wasn’t merely asking me to avoid judgment; he was teaching me empathy, the ability to see life through others' eyes, and the importance of understanding before forming an opinion.

In consequence, I became inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has, over time, shaped my worldview. In the years that followed, this tendency of mine to hold back evaluations allowed me to delve deeper into the lives and experiences of those around me. I found that people, often when they felt safe, were more than willing to open up about their lives—their triumphs, failures, fears, and dreams. It became clear to me that everyone was carrying some form of burden or unspoken grief, whether they were consciously aware of it or not. By withholding my own judgments, I made space for others to be vulnerable, and this created connections that I might not have formed had I acted differently.

The habit of withholding judgment is not without its drawbacks. While it opened up many curious natures to me, it also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The people who were quick to engage in conversations, not out of genuine interest, but because they needed someone to listen to their long-winded rants, would often target me. I was seen as a captive audience, a sounding board for their opinions, whether or not they were relevant or welcome. In my pursuit of understanding others, I became an easy target for those who wished to unload their thoughts without the intention of engaging in a meaningful exchange. It was frustrating at times, yet it served as a reminder that not everyone who speaks does so with the intention of sharing or learning. Some simply want to be heard, regardless of whether their words carry value or not.

This dynamic taught me an important lesson about boundaries. I had to learn when to listen and when to step back. It wasn’t always easy to strike the right balance. The same habit that allowed me to forge connections with insightful, thoughtful individuals also made me susceptible to the energy drain of those who needed constant validation without offering anything in return. It was a delicate dance between showing empathy and maintaining personal boundaries, and one that took years of practice to navigate effectively.

The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college, I was unjustly accused of being a politician. I never quite understood the full extent of the accusation. It wasn’t that I was actively involved in politics or trying to climb the social ladder through manipulation. Rather, I had unknowingly attracted the attention of people who saw in me a strategic mind, someone who could be relied upon to understand the intricacies of relationships, power dynamics, and influence.

The accusation came from a fellow student who had, over the course of our semester, become somewhat of a political activist. He was fervent in his beliefs, always engaging in debates about social justice, governance, and the role of the individual within a greater societal framework. To him, anyone who approached conversations with thoughtfulness and deliberation, as I often did, must be scheming, calculating, and secretly aiming to outmaneuver others. He believed that my measured approach to social interactions—my tendency to listen, absorb, and analyze—was a façade, a way of gaining an upper hand in the game of social politics. To him, I was a player, not a passive participant.

This perception of mine as a politician, as someone who was constantly playing the angles and positioning myself for personal gain, was not only inaccurate but also disheartening. I had never seen myself as someone who needed to manipulate or control others. Instead, I considered myself someone who sought to understand, to learn from every person I met, and to build connections that were genuine and rooted in respect. It was a difficult realization to accept that others, seeing my actions through the lens of their own experiences and biases, would misinterpret my motivations.

Yet, over time, I came to accept that this would not be the last time I was misjudged. In fact, it was just the beginning of a series of misunderstandings that would follow me throughout my life. As I matured, I came to realize that people are quick to label others based on their own preconceived notions, often without taking the time to understand the true essence of a person’s character. It wasn’t that I was being falsely accused of something inherently bad—it was simply that my behavior, my choices, and my approach to life didn’t fit neatly into the boxes that others were familiar with. And that was okay. It was part of the human experience to be misunderstood, and part of growing up was learning how to accept this.

The reality of life is that we are constantly moving in and out of others’ perceptions of us, and there’s little we can do to control the judgments that people make. However, we do have control over how we respond to these judgments. I chose to respond with patience and understanding. I chose to listen, to reflect, and to be present in the lives of those who sought connection. I chose to reserve my judgment, not only of others but of myself, and to grow into the person I was meant to be, regardless of how others might perceive me.

As I look back on the advice my father gave me, I realize that it was more than just a lesson in empathy. It was a lesson in self-awareness and resilience. It taught me that while it’s important to be considerate of others’ circumstances, it’s also important to remain true to oneself. In the face of criticism or misunderstanding, it’s essential to stay grounded in one’s values, to hold on to the integrity that forms the foundation of one’s character. In the end, the judgments of others are fleeting, but the way we choose to live our lives is what truly defines us.

In conclusion, my father’s advice has shaped much of who I am today. It has helped me navigate a world full of judgments, biases, and misinterpretations, allowing me to approach each situation with a sense of humility and understanding. It has taught me that the key to meaningful connections lies not in being quick to judge, but in being open to the experiences, perspectives, and struggles of others. Through this approach, I have learned to build relationships that are deeper, more genuine, and more rewarding. And in the end, I am grateful for the wisdom my father imparted to me, for it has guided me through the complexities of life, and continues to do so with each passing day.
